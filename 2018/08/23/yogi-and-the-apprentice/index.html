		<h3>Manikarnika</h3>
<p>“Wash your hands in the Ganges”, said the Yogi. The Yogi and Padmanabhan were in Manikarnika Ghat, one of the crematory grounds in Varanasi. There were bodies still burning in the Ghat. Paddy had already accompanied the Yogi in a few of his expeditions.<br>“It’s almost midnight, let’s have our dinner”, said the Yogi.<br>“There is no way I am going to eat human f-”, said Paddy. Even before he could complete the sentence, he saw the Yogi materializing curd rice out of thin air.<br>“This would taste pretty much like the curd rice they once used to serve at Grand Sweets, since the founder passed away, the curd rice there hasn’t been the same” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>Paddy was pretty much relieved that it wasn’t an Aghori internship. Paddy was 17 years old, it’s been almost 6 months since he ran away from his house.</p>
<p>“It’s all cool that you materialize things out of thin air, why don’t you teach people dying of hunger to magically create food?” asked Paddy.<br>“It’s too complex paddy, re arranging the atomic composition, channeling the universal energy and all that. They could learn simpler things to not stay hungry. It’s easier to be a software engineer and copy/paste code from stack overflow.” said the Yogi.<br>“But, you could make sure that no one goes hungry with your powers” said paddy.</p>
<p>“Yeah.. but that’s too much effort”, said the Yogi and started indulging himself with the curd rice.<br>“Are there other people like you?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“Obviously, but most of the enlightened ones don’t give a fuck about what happens in this world and are mostly in seclusion. They pretty much try to not come under the law of causality”</p>
<p>It was an information overload for Padmanabhan every time they went on an expedition. Half of them he understood, the other half went right over his head. The Yogi never bothered if Paddy ever understood anything or not. He had a long beard up till his chest and hair that almost reached his shoulders. He looked nothing less than 70, but had the energy of a 10 year old kid.</p>
<p>“Long white hair and beard, what a stereotype” thought Paddy.</p>
<p>“There is this story about the American military recruiting native americans as scouts during the Vietnam war for their exceptional tracking ability. Native americans usually have long hair. Once enlisted into the army and deployed on missions they seemed to fail miserably. They felt that they have lost their intuitive ability to track things just after deployment into missions. Enlisting meant that they cut their hair really short.”<br>“The Buddhist monks who practice renunciation as one of the paths for enlightenment, usually shave their heads too. Pretty much de sensitising themselves from the external environment” said the Yogi</p>
<p>“As for me, I was born in the 50’s, counter culture and stuff paddy”, said the Yogi, as if he could read Padmanabhan’s thoughts out loud.</p>
<p>“Why did you pick me to be your apprentice? It’s not like I applied for it.” asked Padmanabhan<br>“Karma bitch” said the Yogi, collecting ash from the crematory grounds.<br>“So is everything written? I have no free will then? asked Padmanabhan<br>The Yogi was tired answering all his questions, he was getting things done faster when he was alone.<br>“Only if I had a choice to not take you under my wing”, thought the Yogi.<br>“See Paddy, the future holds multiple possibilities, based on your actions, based on others actions, and probably even the big bang”<br>“You can imagine these multiple realities as spider webs criss crossing each other. When more spider webs cross a single point, the more likely, that reality is materialized”<br>“When all the spider webs cross a single point, we call it a convergence, Paddy, a convergence” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“So you can see the future? Then you can change things to make the outcomes favourable right? asked Paddy.</p>
<p>The Yogi had seen his share of dumb people in his life, he somehow felt that Paddy was the dumbest of them all.<br>“Have you even been listening to me? All our actions lead to the next convergence point. You can just be a spectator to it. You are free to do anything in between the convergence points, not that it ever really matters” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>Padmanabhan still couldn’t figure, if he had free will or was acting according to some grand plan.</p>
<p>“It’s about time we get the Yantra” said the Yogi<br>“The what?”</p>
<hr>
<h3>Yantra</h3>
<p>The Yogi was rummaging through the crematory grounds of Manikarnika ghat.</p>
<p>Paddy was washing his hands after finishing off his curd rice. The Yogi barely let him know the purpose of any of these expeditions. He had a faint idea that it was about some Yantra.</p>
<p>Paddy had a feeling that someone was watching him, he could spot a man further to his right, muscular, ash smeared and carrying a shotgun. He was approaching them. He looked around and he could see three more people approaching them.</p>
<p>Before Paddy could come to terms with the situation, the Naga sadhu fired his shotgun right at him.</p>
<p>There was a wall of sand right in front of him shielding him from the pellets. The Yogi was standing beside him with his staff firmly on the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s about time we get out of here”, said the Yogi, lifting paddy of the ground by his collar. The wall of sand collapsed as soon as the Yogi removed the staff of the ground.</p>
<p>The Yogi was taking really long strides walking away from the ghat. Paddy had never seen him run, whatever the circumstance, he would always walk.</p>
<p>As soon as they came out of the ghat, the Yogi hopped on to a Royal Enfield Classic 500.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the bike on which we got here” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Oh, is it?”</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t be doing this, no matter what the circumstance” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Your moral compass isn’t something that is going to impress me Paddy” said the Yogi. Both of them swerved through the narrow lanes of Varanasi and got to the Highway.</p>
<p>“But this isn’t right, this is someone else’s hard earned money” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“There is no right or wrong in this world Paddy, just actions and reactions”</p>
<p>These so called morals are man made Paddy. It’s their only way to compensate for the inequities of life. People try so hard to enforce it, make the world a fair place to live in, but the universe is intrinsically unfair Paddy.</p>
<p>There is only the law of causation Paddy, you don’t need to believe in it, nobody needs to enforce it, it just exists.</p>
<p>“You mean like gravity!”, said Paddy with a sense pride, he felt good that he was finally able to grasp what the Yogi said and provide analogies.</p>
<p>“ah.. yeah.. something like that”, said the Yogi and placed the yantra in the bike’s tank cover. The bullet was off with a start, zooming straight into the sky, like a flight taking off from a runway.</p>
<p>“Fucckkkkkkkkk” said Paddy, the only response that his brain could make up after processing all the incomprehensible data around.</p>
<p>“This is total bullshit” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>“Why do you need a bullet to fly? If you are all so powerful, you could fly on your own right?” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Oh, I wish Paddy. It takes years of practice to master one skill. You know how long it took me to materialise Grand Sweet’s curd rice out of thin air? You live long enough only to acquire a few skills in your lifetime. You need to figure out your priorities before you run out of time Paddy”</p>
<p>And since one can’t master all the skills in the world, we have this thing called Yantras. Basically a metallic disc with inscriptions on it. I am good at making curd rice, so I can make a Yantra that does the same. So anyone can just use the Yantra to materialise curd rice. My Yantra is on high demand in the market Paddy.</p>
<p>And this yantra here let’s inanimate objects fly, basically nullyfying the effect of gravitons, said the Yogi tapping on the tank cover. That’s what our expedition was all about, there are not many of these left anymore.</p>
<p>It was about an hour since they were riding on the bike, passing through the clouds, with lots of turbulence to accompany them.</p>
<p>Since the talk about the Yantras, Padmanabhan was wondering about the possibilities of them.</p>
<p>“So, can you, umm.. bring someone back from the dead using a Yantra?” asked Paddy hesitantly.</p>
<p>“I tell you that you can materialise curd rice, and this is the extent of your imagination? I am very dissappointed Paddy.” said the Yogi.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Enlightenment</strong></h3>
<p>Padmanabhan was done with his 12th board exams, he could clearly see where his life was heading. He would take up engineering, land himself in an IT job, get married and end up rest of the life earning only to pay for the house loan and putting his kids through school. At best all this would come to an end with a heart attack, at worst, with colon cancer. It didn’t matter if he earned more or earned less. The path was more or less in the same ballpark. Adding to that, he would be helping his kids get into the same vicious cycle. He wanted to end the cycle once and for all. He packed his bags, took some cash and left without telling his parents.</p>
<p>There was a sudden jerk, when the bike landed on the ground. Paddy had fallen asleep with the cool breeze whizzing over his head. They landed at some ghat near the banks of the Ganges.</p>
<p>“All this driving has made me hungry all over again, do you care for some curd rice?” asked the Yogi. Padmanabhan wasn’t in the mood to eat, he joined the Yogi in the hopes of finding an answer, the answer to end the cycle.</p>
<p>“I have been meaning to ask you something for a long time and I have been in search for it ever since I left home. Who am I? Do I have an existence beyond these flesh and bones?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“ Huh?, You have been reading too much philosophy paddy, especially the existential ones. I think these questions aren’t truly yours, but fed to you by the books that you have read.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Anyway, the answers I give to you now will be of no use”</p>
<p>“Why would that be?” asked paddy.</p>
<p>“You are already full of ideas Paddy, nothing I tell will get to you. Or maybe wait. I don’t want to preach about what enlightenment is, you have already read a lot of stuff about it. I’ll show you someone who is enlightened, and maybe you can figure things out yourself. He lives close by, we’ll go to him first thing tomorrow morning” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>It was around 7 in the morning. The streets of Varanasi were wide enough for one motorcycle to pass at a time, but was accommodating enough to allow pedestrians, cows and motorcycles to pass both ways at the same time.</p>
<p>“This is the street where he lives” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>Paddy saw a really old person with unkempt long hair and shabby beard. He was wrapped in a torn black blanket and begging for alms. Out of some natural instinct, he touched the beggar’s feet and made a shastanga namaskaram.</p>
<p>“I really admire your respect and humility towards the old. But that is not the person we came to meet.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“What? he isn’t the enlightened one?”</p>
<p>“You read too many books for your own good Paddy, not all enlightened souls are beggars or live in the Himalayas” said the Yogi and went to the tea stall near by.</p>
<p>He asked for two cups of tea, which were served in a Kulhar, a clay cup.</p>
<p>“So you see the tea master there, Paddy? He is the one we came to meet.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“He is enlightened? But why does he sell tea?”</p>
<p>“Because, he used to sell tea before he was enlightened.”</p>
<p>“So what did he do to become enlightened?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“He was making tea, and one day enlightenment just struck him, and then he kept making tea” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>“This is the most stupid enlightenment story I have ever heard” said Paddy.</p>
<p>The whole world came crashing down on him, he was devastated. Whatever he had thought of what enlightenment would be was completely different from the reality that was in front of him. He expected to become a Buddha or at least a spiritual guru of a small cult in the US of A after enlightenment. This was incomprehensible to him.</p>
<p>The Yogi could see how devastated Paddy was. He asked him to take a sip of the tea to regain himself.</p>
<p>He had a sip and said, “The tea is mediocre too, I thought this would be some deva amrutham level tea, I make better tea than this”.</p>
<p>“There there, that is enough for today I guess, you want to have a chat with the tea master?” asked the Yogi.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Tea Master</h3>
<p>“Is the Tea master a karma yogi? He does his work with so much involvement and without any expectation of results, that he attained enlightenment even without his knowing?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“I like the little bubble under which you live Paddy, but he is just an output of the last convergence. The infinite space time realities converging at a single point, remember? No matter what he did, he would have wound up getting enlightened.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“What effect did the last convergence have on you?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“I had to take a dump during that time, Paddy, I was on a juice cleanse four days before that, but it was the fucking convergence. Now, that’s besides the point, we are here to talk with the Tea master, now go on, ask him what you want.”</p>
<p>Paddy headed towards the Tea master nervously.</p>
<p>“Hi”, said Paddy</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“So…, you are enlightened?”</p>
<p>“You can call it that.” said the Tea Master.</p>
<p>“So, what’s it like to be enlightened? and why do you still sell tea?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“Now, where do I start? To put it in a gist, it’s quite boring.”</p>
<p>“Before all this, I would say life was much more fun, used to worry about the increase in milk prices every day, was trying to figure out ways to extract extra decoction from a used batch of tea leaves. Knowing the reality of the existence of tea leaves sucks the joy out of all these stuff, if you know what I mean”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t know what you mean”, said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, yes. I guess you are in pursuit of enlightenment, that’s the most fun you can have without actually having to do anything, theorizing on your existence, on the reality of things, your parents provide you with roti, kapda and makhan, so what else do you do?”</p>
<p>“Bread, clothes and a roof over your head”, said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got that part”, said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Read a couple of books on Zen, Motorcycles, and everything in between. Look at other people who go about their daily lives with condescension. Impart your wisdom on others without their consent. The pursuit of enlightenment is one jolly ride Paddy. And…”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s enough for today” interjected the Yogi. “So, we ll take leave then”.</p>
<p>After walking a couple of steps away from the tea stall, the yogi asked “What did you learn today Paddy?, What’s the moral of the story?”</p>
<p>“That the pursuit of enlightenment is an elitist fascination?”</p>
<p>“No, that you will wind up selling tea if you undersell your products”</p>
<h4>OYO Rooms</h4>
<p>When the Yogi said, “We ll go some place pleasant, I have to do my sadhana.” Paddy was expecting an ashram in the Himalayas. OYO rooms in Varanasi was the last place that he expected the yogi to perform his sadhana at.</p>
<p>And by Sadhana, he expected the Yogi to at least sit in Padmasana. But the Yogi was lying completely horizontal across the bed and watching Gemini Ganesan lip sync to Nilave Ennidam Nerungathe in K TV.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t we have gone to any ashram?” asked Padmanabhan.</p>
<p>“There is no hot water there Paddy, and winters in North India are not so pleasant. Here with a Geyser we have 24 hour hot water supply.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you do some magic and create a hot water spring or something?” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Firstly, it’s not magic, it’s a skill that you develop over years of practice. And your lifetime is only long enough to learn one skill and perfect it. In hindsight, it’s good that I didn’t learn how to create hot water, the invention of an affordable geyser has made it pointless. There was this old friend of mine who turned water to wine, this was all before the advent of large scale distilleries, have you ever been to Pondicherry, Paddy?” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“But I thought you would be doing some kind of kriya/kundalini Yoga and teach me something too” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Why do anything Paddy, when you can just be” said the Yogi and turned around in the bed to lay completely flat.</p>
<p>“Corny fucker” mumbled Paddy to himself with a sense of resignation that he is never going to learn anything from the Yogi.</p>
<p>While the Yogi was going on about how technology was making the skills in the yogic world redundant, Paddy was busy peering through the window looking at people strolling through their mundane life.<br>“Is there some Reggae band performing in our hotel tonight?” asked Paddy.</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?” said the Yogi, getting out of the bed and sitting upright.<br>“I just saw some hippies entering our hotel carrying a guitar case” said Paddy.<br>The Yogi jumped out of the bed and peered through the window. He saw two men with dreadlocks, carrying a guitar case wearing suits.<br>They are the same people who attacked us at the Manikarnika Ghat Paddy. This time they have cornered us with no way to escape. One guy will be taking the stairs and the other guy will take the lift and we are in the 6th floor.</p>
<p>Paddy’s memory of the Naga sadhus firing at him with a shotgun was still fresh.<br>What do we do now? asked Paddy with fear clearly dripping from his body.</p>
<p>“You remember the Yantra that we used to make the bullet bike fly? Here take this, and go stand in the balcony.” said the Yogi tossing the Yantra to Padmanabhan. “They are sure to break the door in a single blow and attack us Paddy. The moment they break the door, you jump out of the balcony, the Yantra will make sure you have a soft landing.”</p>
<p>“And what will you do?” asked Paddy with concern.</p>
<p>“Oh, I will hide in the bathroom and wait it out, Paddy, You ll have enough time to cut them loose after the jump, we can catch up at the Tea Master’s.” said the Yogi and proceeded to get into the bathroom.<br>“Wait, you said this yantra diminishes the effect of gravitons only on inanimate objects” said Paddy.<br>“Have some faith Paddy, why would I give you a yantra that works only on inanimate objects and ask you to take a leap of faith from 6 floors above?” said the Yogi and went ahead and locked himself in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Paddy thought to himself that the Yogi wouldn’t go to such lengths as sacrificing his apprentice to save himself. But he still remembered very clearly that the Yantra worked only on inanimate objects.<br>While contemplating the possibilities standing at the edge of the balcony, he heard a huge sound and the door in front of him shattered to pieces.<br>The Naga sadhu came into room with his shotgun pointing right at Paddy.<br>Paddy was about to jump from the balcony holding the Yantra, but at the last moment he decided not to. He wasn’t feeling any lighter holding the Yantra.<br>That was enough time for the Naga sadhu, he cocked his shotgun and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Right at that moment the bathroom door that was to the right of the Naga sadhu burst into pieces from a shock wave from inside the bathroom traveling right across the room and hitting the Naga sadhu.</p>
<p>The Naga sadhu was thrown away by the shock wave to the corner of the room and he collapsed to never regain consciousness.</p>
<p>The Yogi was inside the bathroom, with his staff firmly held on the floor.</p>
<p>The second Naga sadhu who was outside the room witnessing all that happened cocked his shot gun and entered the room turning towards the Yogi and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The Yogi calmly walked out of the bathroom like he had all the time in the world and used his staff to push the shotgun aside a little to his left.</p>
<p>The shot missed the yogi by an angle of 30 degrees and hit the walls.</p>
<p>After pushing the shotgun away in the gentlest ways, he flicked the staff and it hit Naga sadhu right under his chin.</p>
<p>The soft upper cut with the staff took his feet right of the ground and the Naga sadhu fell on the ground in a parabolic trajectory.</p>
<h4>Viddi Kushmandam</h4>
<p>The Yogi turned towards Paddy to see that he was stunned. Paddy had once seen the Yogi shield him with a wall of sand using his staff, but didn’t know that there was an action hero inside the Yogi.</p>
<p>Paddy had read his fair share of stories. He realised that this was a test by the Yogi to guage his faith in his guru, and he had miserably failed it.</p>
<p>But Paddy never believed in blind faith, that’s one of the reasons he couldn’t find his answer in religion and had to leave his home in search of enlightenment.</p>
<p>He felt he had to confront the Yogi about this.</p>
<p>“Faith is a useful tool Paddy” said the Yogi, as if reading Padmanabhan’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“If you are going to base all your actions on logic, data and results, you’ll never make a decision in your life, Paddy. There is a finiteness to the things that you can understand with your intellect. You may feel that making a decision based on faith is uncertain. That you have no idea what the results could be. You may even say that a life based on faith is gambling Paddy. But only gamblers know what life is.”</p>
<p>“There is this story that my guru once told me, I’ll tell that on our way out, let’s take the stairs just for safety.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Another zen story I bet” mumbled Paddy.</p>
<p>“Actually, it is from a book called Aithihyamala, quite famous in Kerala. There was a person whose name I don’t remember, who was a landless peasant. In his village there was a renowned doctor, who could cure any disease. The doctor was said to be a very pious person, and the rumour was that he had a special mantra that one of the Siddha’s passed on to him. The peasant wanted to apprentice under the doctor, and wanted to cure people the same way. But he didn’t know how to win the doctor’s favour to get him under his wing. So he took one really large pumpkin that was growing in the back of his house as a guru dakshina to the doctor.<br>So, early morning, the very next day, he placed the pumpkin right in front of the doctor’s house and was waiting for the doctor to come out.<br>When the doctor opened the door, the peasant made a shastanga namaskara asking him to be initiated as a disciple by teaching him the mantra.<br>The doctor did not notice the pumpkin placed below him and tripped over it and shouted, “Viddi (Idiot)! Kushmandam(pumpkin)?”.</p>
<p>The peasant didn’t know what it meant, but was very happy that the doctor had accepted him and even parted with his mantra.</p>
<p>So every day, for the next 18 years, he chanted the mantra with all his heart and soul put into it.</p>
<p>So one day after 18 years, the doctor himself gets sick.You might have already guessed where the story is going Paddy, all doctors across the country said that they couldn’t help him. One fine day, a young doctor, who was renowned for his occult skills world over, agreed to take a look at him. He took a bit of water from his kamandalam,chanted a mantra and sprinkled it over the Doctor. He was instantly cured. The doctor was very curious to know who this young person was and what mantra he had used. The doctor got a mild cardiac arrest when he heard that the mantra was “Viddi Kushmandam” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“But that’s just a story” said Paddy, not at all convinced. They had reached the first floor, coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Now I’ll take the jump with the Yantra.This way you can say that I had faith and even if I go wrong, there wouldn’t be any irreversible damage” said Paddy and jumped over the last flight of stairs.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the soft landing that the Yogi promised, he heard a sound ‘click’ from his ankle, and a sharp pain shot through his entire body.</p>
<p>“Oh, so it really works only on inanimate objects.” said the Yogi coming down the flight of stairs, casually.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Paddy?” asked the Yogi, giving him a water bottle to take a sip and calm his nerves.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not” said Paddy throbbing with pain.</p>
<p>“I told you Paddy, putting your faith on something is like gambling.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>He took the water bottle and had a sip, himself. Took some water in his hands and said “Viddi Kushmandam” and sprinkled it on his ankle. The jumbo-sized ankle from all the swelling, instantly shrank back to its normal form.</p>
<h3>Shvethakethu</h3>
<p>A couple of days had passed since the incident at OYO . Yogi suggested to go to Rishikesh after the incident, since he had an old friend at Rishikesh.</p>
<p>Padmanbhan and the Yogi were riding through the streets of Rishikesh. It was easier to find ashrams in Rishikesh than hotels. It seemed to be the market for enlightenment. If you sought enlightenment, you had different products to choose from, each competing with the other, applying for patents for specific instructional material and packages for retreat in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Padmanabhan had consumed his fair share of books and yoga products in his search for enlightenment. Paddy’s search for enlightenment slowly turned into a search for a Guru, for a Guru was material and easier to spot. During this search he had come across many people, from pure circus acts to the highly intellectual ones. Meeting the Yogi was a pure accident and he never really offered to be his Guru. “You can travel with me if you want, but expect nothing more” was the only thing that the Yogi had said before taking Padmanabhan along with him for his expeditions.</p>
<p>Paddy had learnt so many things from so many masters that now he felt that maybe he had already attained self realization and that he just didn’t notice it. Like the Tea Master that the Yogi showed him, there was nothing different about him, he kept making very mediocre tea and the Yogi had said that the Tea Master was enlightened.</p>
<p>“Maybe I am already enlightened and I just didn’t notice it yet” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I mean, I get it. The same consciousness running through all of us, we are all but parts of the same one, and there is no difference between the parts and the one.” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Don’t intellectualize everything Paddy, just chill. You know this formula F = mg, right?” asked the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Ofcourse, the force acting on a freely falling body. 8th std science” chuckled Padmanabhan.</p>
<p>“But you really don’t have to pass 8th std to jump off a cliff you know?” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>“It’s great to know how things work, say when you throw a cricket ball the whole mechanics of it, but you can never really know what it is like throwing a ball until you throw one.”</p>
<p>“Ok, you are not really helping me here, so what do I exactly need to do, just tell me that, and don’t sell me this generic bullshit of asking me to do nothing, it’s the current decade’s “Carpe Diem”. I know it sounds deep and everything, but give me a solution that I could really use”, said Paddy.</p>
<p>“Come with me then.” said the Yogi and Paddy hopped on to the back seat of the Royal Enfield.</p>
<p>After a 15 minute ride they reached an Independent house. Both the Yogi and Paddy went towards the house and the Yogi knocked on the door.A lady answered the door and was surprised to see an old man and a teenager at her doorstep. Paddy could see the inside of the house and it was full of kids not more than 3 years old. It was an informal creche where working parents sent their kids to be taken care of during the day.</p>
<p>“Paddy here will take care of the kids, you can go and attend to your mom at the hospital.” said the Yogi.</p>
<p>Paddy never believed in fairy tales, but every day spent with the Yogi, he was unlearning more than he was learning.It was no hypnosis that was employed at that moment. The yogi said the words with so much conviction that it directly connected with the lady. There was no need for logic or analysis at that place, the lady thanked the Yogi and warned Paddy to better take good care of them and left for the hospital.</p>
<p>“Hi Sundar” said Yogi to a 2 year old kid.</p>
<p>“This was the friend in Rishikesh that you were talking about?!”</p>
<p>“Ahan”</p>
<p>Sundar came toddling towards the Yogi and offered his sip-up water bottle.</p>
<p>“Ah!, Thanks” said the Yogi and drank some from it. “I was really thirsty, you need some Paddy? And by the way Sundar, this is Paddy. Paddy, Sundar”.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Ok the lady will be back by noon. And don’t worry about what the lady said, the kids can take care of themselves. You just take care of yourself. I’ll come to pick you up by noon” said the Yogi and left the house.</p>
<h3>Happiness</h3>
<p>It was around 2 at noon that the Yogi came back in his Royal Enfield to the creche.</p>
<p>The lady had come back from the hospital too and Paddy was waiting outside.</p>
<p>“So how was it with the kids?” asked the Yogi.</p>
<p>“Ok I get it, the kids seem to be happy despite all the shit going around. No care in the world. I have to be more like them, I get it. Happiness is a state of mind, yada yada yada” said Paddy.</p>
<p>“No Paddy, you don’t get the point, you will never be happy. Unhappiness is what drives this world, Paddy.”</p>
<p>“What?” asked Padmanabhan.</p>
<p>“Let us go back to an example that used to make us happy, Paddy. You are home sitting and watching a movie and you are totally engrossed in it. Suddenly, the film cuts to an ad break, the first advertisement that comes is that of an ice cream brand. You haven’t had any ice cream for a while. Suddenly a thought is generated in your head to have an ice cream, not exactly the one that they show in the ad, but your personal favourite. Though the thought generation was induced due to an external factor, it is generated from within.</p>
<p>Our mind has this supernatural ability to transport us from the present surroundings, to the place, object or action associated with the thought.</p>
<p>Only when we get to eat the ice cream, the thought dissipates and we come back to the present. This is exactly the moment when we are happy, when we feel relaxed and when we are peace.</p>
<p>The uneasiness till the action associated with the thought is completed is the very driving force to get the action done.</p>
<p>You are bound to be miserable Paddy, that’s how things are.</p>
<p>As for the kids, wait till they become adults to be miserable as the rest of us. They are happy as kids, miserable as adults, as a society we fuck them up in between. You are already fucked Paddy, unfuck yourself and things will dawn on you.”</p>
<p>“How do I do that?” asked Paddy with complete seriousness.</p>
<p>“Oh, for that you can enroll into a happiness workshop which is quite common these days.”</p>
<p>“Which happiness workshop would you recommend?”</p>
<p>“My God, have you even been listening to what I have been saying, Paddy.”.</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>

I dont think its necessary to believe that there is life after death since its not something that can be ascertained and it would also restrict your further search for a meaning that you would be convinced of. I can say that you don&#039;t believe in the concept of life after death as of now, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t have gone further in search of a meaning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even i am going through all that mate but now atleast i have a little clarity. If you want to deep dive into this i recommend you attend Vippassana course. You can check out about it and also apply for the course in www.dhamma.org . Its a 10 day course where you will lead a ascetic life. They charge not a penny for the course and If you are satisfied with the 10 day course then you may donate as much as you want. Try it buddy. :) Nice article buddy.]]></description>

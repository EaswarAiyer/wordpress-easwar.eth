					<description><![CDATA[Spirituality is to have an open mind and accept all the possibilities. So you can never limit a spiritual person with some boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;Being strictly spiritual is to be as free as possible. ]]></description>

Don&#039;t you think spiritual beings are religious about their spirituality? If so, doesn&#039;t that make them religious as well? If not, does that mean they are not strictly spiritual?&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
